# `isaac-typescript-definitions`

The `isaac-typescript-definitions` package contains the definitions for the vanilla Isaac Lua API. It also includes bugfixes and quality of life changes that they developers have not bothered to implement yet.

You can explore what `isaac-typescript-definitions` offers via the left navigation bar.

Note that this documentation is automatically generated from [the source files](https://github.com/IsaacScript/isaacscript/tree/main/packages/isaac-typescript-definitions/src). However, due to artifacts with the auto-generation process, the left navigation bar is organized in a weird way and some of the links may be broken.

It's recommended that if you want to learn about the Isaac API, you use [Wofsauge's documentation](https://wofsauge.github.io/IsaacDocs/rep/) instead of this one. Alternatively, you can view [the TypeScript definition source files](https://github.com/IsaacScript/isaacscript/tree/main/packages/isaac-typescript-definitions/src) directly.

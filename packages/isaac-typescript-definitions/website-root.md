# `isaac-typescript-definitions`

The `isaac-typescript-definitions` package contains the definitions for the vanilla Isaac Lua API. It also includes bugfixes and quality of life changes that they developers have not bothered to implement yet.

You can explore what `isaac-typescript-definitions` offers via the left navigation bar.

Right now, only documentation for the enums are generated. If you want to learn about the classes in the API (like `Entity` or `Isaac`), then you should use [Wofsauge's documentation](https://wofsauge.github.io/IsaacDocs/rep/). Alternatively, you can view [the TypeScript definition source files](https://github.com/IsaacScript/isaacscript/tree/main/packages/isaac-typescript-definitions/src) directly.

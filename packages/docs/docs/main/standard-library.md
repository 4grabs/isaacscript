title: IsaacScript Standard Library
---

In addition to having access to all of the vanilla classes and enums, IsaacScript mods also can access optional helper functions & features. These are bundled as part of the `isaacscript-common` package. Think of this as an extended part of the Isaac API; they can perform common tasks in a safe way that abstracts away the complexity from you.

For documentation on `isaacscript-common`, see the [automatically generated documentation](/isaacscript-common).

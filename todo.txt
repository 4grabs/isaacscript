- Slaughterhouse I and II (need to travel to Slaughterhouse II)

- custom bosses for vanilla stages

- Lint:
  - lint failure: https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/issues/897
  - prefer implicit loops for arrays, maps, etc. - not implicit, but "default iterator"?
  - double period for end of JSDoc comment lint
  - lint rule: arrays, maps, and sets that start with Capital letter must be read-only

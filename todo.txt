- polty doesn't trigger grid entity break
- use typedoc rename plugin

- Lint:
  - lint failure: https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/issues/897
  - prefer implicit loops for arrays, maps, etc. - not implicit, but "default iterator"?
  - double period for end of JSDoc comment lint
  - lint rule: arrays, maps, and sets that start with Capital letter must be read-only




lint error, missing warning for "verbose" missing:

 * Custom stages/levels must first be defined in the "tsconfig.json" file. See the documentation for

 * @param name The name of the custom stage, corresponding to what is in the "tsconfig.json" file.
 * @param firstFloor Whether to go to the first floor or the second floor. For example, if you have

lint failure, complete sentences:

 * Custom grid entities are built on top of real grid entities. You can use any existing grid entity

- redo postGridEntityCustomBroken, add hasSubscriptions function
- remove decoration variant
- normal grid entity callbacks should not fire for custom entities
- check for registerCustomBoss and throw run-time error if not present
- specify base XML type for custom entity
- polty

- Lint:
  - lint failure: https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/issues/897
  - prefer implicit loops for arrays, maps, etc. - not implicit, but "default iterator"?
  - double period for end of JSDoc comment lint
  - lint rule: arrays, maps, and sets that start with Capital letter must be read-only

 * @param name The name of the custom stage, corresponding to what is in the "tsconfig.json" file.
 * @param firstFloor Whether to go to the first floor or the second floor. For example, if you have
 *                   a custom stage emulating Caves, then the first floor would be Caves 1, and the
 *                   second floor would be Caves 2.

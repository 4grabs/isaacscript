title: Isaacscript Common
---

IsaacScript mods automatically have access to optional helper functions & features. These are bundled as part of the `isaacscript-common` package. Think of this as an extended part of the Isaac API; they can perform common tasks in a safe way that abstracts away the complexity from you.

For documentation on `isaacscript-common`, see the [automatically generated TypeDoc pages](https://isaacscript.github.io/isaacscript-common/index.html).

title: Is IsaacScript Right for Me?

Coding in TypeScript is a bit more complicated than coding in Lua. And it requires more tooling to be installed. This means that `isaacscript` isn't right for everyone. Whether or not you should use the framework depends on several factors.

<br />

### Are you a beginner, intermediate, or expert Isaac modder?

- Beginner - ❌ - If you want to code an Isaac mod for the first time, do it in Lua. Keep it simple, stupid!
- Intermediate - ✔️ - If you have already made a few mods, then you are ready for all of the advantages `isaacscript` brings.
- Expert - ✔️ - Using `isaacscript` is a no-brainer.

### How much time are you spending on coding Isaac mods?

- Not a lot of time - ❌ - Code up quick mods in Lua and be done with them.
- A lot of time - ✔️ - Using `isaacscript` will save you a ton of time:
  - Automatic formatting and tab-complete makes typing up mod code twice as fast.
  - With automatic in-game loading, testing your mods is lightning fast.
  - You will waste less time running-around in-game debugging run-time errors.

### What is the size of the mod you are building?

- A tiny mod - ❌ - Tiny mods are less likely to have bugs or typos.
- A medium mod - ✔️ - If your mod is big enough to be split into two or more files, then using `isaacscript` will be helpful. And if you will update the mod in the future (with new features or bug fixes), then using `isaacscript` will help you maintain the project.
- A big mod - ✔️ - Using `isaacscript` is a no-brainer.

### Do you have experience in JavaScript (or TypeScript)?

- No, I've only coded in Lua - ❌ - Lua is pretty similar to JavaScript. But if you don't want to spend any time to learn a new language, then stick with Lua!
- No, but I have coded in other languages - ✔️ - JavaScript is one of the easiest languages to learn (alongside Python). Getting started is a breeze.
- Yes, I have experience in JavaScript - ✔️ - TypeScript is 99% the same as JavaScript. (It is a "superset" language.)
- Yes, I have experience in TypeScript - ✔️ - You're golden.
